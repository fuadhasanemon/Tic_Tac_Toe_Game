# Tic Tac Toe Game Project using Python

Tic tac toe is a very popular game and we are going to implement the tic tac toe game using Python programming. Let us examine some of the rules of the game:-

Play occurs on a 3 by 3 grid of 9 squares.
Two players take turns marking empty squares, the first marking X’s, the second O’s.
A row is any three squares on the grid, adjacent diagonally, vertically or horizontally.
If one player places three of the same marks in a row, the player wins.
If the spaces are all filled and there is no winner, the game ends in a draw.
